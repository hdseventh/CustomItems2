Custom Items plugin originally by [Johuan/Interverse](https://github.com/Interverse/CustomItems), updated by me.

- Allows you to spawn an item with custom attributes.
- These items will reset when you drop it, store the item in a chest or other container, or leave the server, so you cannot transfer it to another person.
